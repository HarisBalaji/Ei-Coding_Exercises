# Ei-Coding Exercise

## 1. Design patterns

## i) Behavioral Design Patterns
Use Case 1: Observer Pattern
Scenario: Stock Price Monitoring System
Description: Implement a stock price monitoring system where multiple clients (observers) subscribe to updates on stock prices. Whenever the stock price changes, the system notifies all subscribed clients.

Use Case 2: Strategy Pattern
* Scenario: Payment Processing System
* Description: Implement a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer). The system should be able to switch between different payment strategies at runtime based on user selection.

## ii) Creational Design Patterns
* Use Case 3: Singleton Pattern
* Scenario: Configuration Manager
Description: Implement a configuration manager that ensures only one instance of the configuration settings exists throughout the application. This manager should be thread-safe and provide global access to the configuration settings.

* Use Case 4: Factory Pattern
* Scenario: Notification System
Description: Implement a notification system that can send different types of notifications (e.g., Email, SMS, Push Notification) based on the input parameters. The system should use a factory to instantiate the appropriate notification objects.
