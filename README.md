## 1. Design patterns

## i) Behavioral Design Patterns
Use Case 1: Observer Pattern
* Scenario: Stock Price Monitoring System
* Description: Implement a stock price monitoring system where multiple clients (observers) subscribe to updates on stock prices. Whenever the stock price changes, the system notifies all subscribed clients.

Use Case 2: Strategy Pattern
* Scenario: Payment Processing System
* Description: Implement a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer). The system should be able to switch between different payment strategies at runtime based on user selection.

## ii) Creational Design Patterns
Use Case 3: Singleton Pattern
* Scenario: Configuration Manager
* Description: Implement a configuration manager that ensures only one instance of the configuration settings exists throughout the application. This manager should be thread-safe and provide global access to the configuration settings.

Use Case 4: Factory Pattern
* Scenario: Notification System
* Description: Implement a notification system that can send different types of notifications (e.g., Email, SMS, Push Notification) based on the input parameters. The system should use a factory to instantiate the appropriate notification objects.

## iii) Structural Design Patterns
Use Case 5: Adapter Pattern
* Scenario: Legacy System Integration
* Description: Implement an adapter to integrate a new payment gateway with an existing e-commerce system. The existing system expects a specific interface, but the new payment gateway has a different interface. The adapter will translate between the two interfaces.

Use Case 6: Composite Pattern
* Scenario: File System Hierarchy
* Description: Implement a file system hierarchy where files and directories are represented as a tree structure. Each directory can contain files and other directories. The system should allow operations like adding, removing, and displaying details of files and directories.
